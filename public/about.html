<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Nathan Smith — an aspiring web designer with a deep passion for technology, computers, and all things digital. I'm currently building my skills in front-end development, with a focus on creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>While I'm at the beginning of my web design journey, I'm committed to learning, improving, and staying up to date with the latest tools and trends in the industry. I approach every project with curiosity, creativity, and a strong desire to solve problems through smart design.</p>

<p>Outside of tech, I'm a dedicated family man — my family is my foundation and greatest motivation. When I'm not coding or learning something new, you’ll likely find me gaming or exploring the latest in hardware and software.

I'm excited to grow in this field and bring fresh ideas to the web.</p>
